# Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to utilize various machine learning methods to assess the dataset for LendingClub to identify factors contributing to credit risk. We used Random Over Sampler and SMOTE algorithms to oversample the dataset, then we used Cluster Centroids to under sample the algorithrm. We also used Balanced Random Forest Classifier and Easy Ensemble Classifier to predict the credit risk, both of which methods reduce bias in calculating the results.
